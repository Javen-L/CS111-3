A multi-process telnet-like client and server that demonstrates compressed network communication. The 2 executables lab1b-client and lab1b-server builds a client-side and server-side agents that handle the network communication and shield the application from other complexities.

lab1b-client.c: C source module that compile to the executable lab1b-client.

lab1b-server.c: C source module that compile to the executable lab1b-server.

Makefile: compile and build the executables lab1b-client and lab1b-server from the C source files with distinct targets for each file and a default target for both. A clean target that returns the directory to its un-tarred states. And a dist target that builds the contents of the tarball.
